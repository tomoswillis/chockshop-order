            The guaranteed audience at food festivals, markets and other live
            events offers the perfect opportunity to share the love for Chock
            Shop brownies. <br />
            <br />
            As more traditional dessert foods have become replaced by
            American-style cookies, cakes and muffins, our market has grown. The
            UK bakery sector was valued at £3.6bn in 2015, with UK consumers
            buying over 1.5 billion sweet baked items, such as cakes, cookies,
            brownies, doughnuts, etc. This represented a 5.5% increase over the
            previous year. <br />
            <br />
            Our growing appetite for baked goodies is reflected in increasing
            content in the media, through shows such as The Great British Bake
            Off helping to raise the profile of high quality baked goods.
